"You are babysitting your sisterâ€™s young child, who is nervous and upset about his mother being away. You are trying to calm him down and offer him some ice cream. As you are dishing out the ice cream, the child bites down hard on your hand. How would you react?"

Conversely, PBDI type questions, ask the candidates "about past behaviour with the assumption that past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour." An example of a PBDI type questions is:


Many of us have had to deal with juggling busy schedules. Think of a time in the past when an important but unscheduled situation arose that required your attention, but you had a number of prior commitments on your agenda. What did you do? What was the outcome?

Notice how SI questions are typically future-oriented, as opposed to PBDI questions, which are past-oriented. The specific and actual SI and PBDI questions are devised according to seven competencies, that the CDA has found to be reliable and valid indicators of future performance. In other words, every question that is asked during a dental school interview, regardless of being a SI or PBDI question, will address one or more than one of the seven competencies.',
